#35. np.absolute take the absolute value of each element. Given that, what would the result be of the following expression:
#np.absolute(-(one_dim[3:])

import numpy as np
from variable_exercise29_to_36 import one_dim

#np.absolute(-(one_dim[3:])) = [-4, -5] = [4,5]

print(np.absolute(-(one_dim[3:])))
